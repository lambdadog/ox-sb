ox-sb - SpaceBattles/Sufficient Velocity BBCode export for Org
==============================================================

An [Org](https://orgmode.org) export backend that generates
[BBCode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBCode) suitable for the
SpaceBattles and Sufficient Velocity forums.

I use this for my writing, which I publish on Sufficient Velocity.
